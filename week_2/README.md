## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Implement and understand **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm
- Build **Decision Trees** from scratch
- Understand **logistic regression** and the sigmoid function
- Apply **gradient descent** for optimization
- Evaluate classifier performance

## 📝 Assignment: Week 2

Complete the exercises in [`ML.ipynb`](ML.ipynb). Each function you implement will be tested for correctness using **automark**.

### 📋 Instructions

1. Open the [`ML.ipynb`](ML.ipynb) notebook
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions
3. Implement the required functions
4. Test your implementations using automark

### ✅ Grading

- You are registered using your student number
- Each function is automatically tested for correctness
- If your student number is not registered, contact a TA during class
