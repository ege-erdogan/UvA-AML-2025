## üìö Overview

During this course, we will use [Python](https://www.python.org) to perform matrix computations, image manipulation, and retrieval tasks. This week provides an introduction to Python and essential libraries you'll need throughout the course.

> **üìì Main Resource:** See [`Intro.ipynb`](Intro.ipynb) for detailed examples and exercises.

### Why Python?

Python is a popular high-level programming language with an emphasis on code readability and concise syntax. Key features that make it easy to learn:

- **Dynamic type system** ‚Äì No need to explicitly declare variable types (`int`, `float`, `string`). Python infers them automatically.
- **Automatic memory management** ‚Äì No manual memory allocation or pointer management required.
- **Rich library ecosystem** ‚Äì From math libraries to game engines, thousands of packages are ready to use.

Feel free to experiment with the language to understand how it works. We're confident that those new to Python will quickly come to appreciate it!

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Installation

> **Note for Linux users:** Most distributions come with Python pre-installed, though using Anaconda still has advantages for package management.

**Recommended:** Python 3.6 or newer via **Anaconda**

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is a scientific Python distribution that includes:
- Python interpreter
- Virtual environment manager
- Popular scientific libraries
- Useful utilities

Note that other ways of setting up Python and packages exist. If you are comfortable using the command line, check out the Recommended Tools section below!

**Installation steps:**
1. Download the appropriate version of Anaconda
2. Follow the installation instructions
3. Create and activate the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate aml2025
```

4. **(Linux/macOS only)** Add `anaconda/bin` to your `PATH`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

> While other installation methods exist, we recommend Anaconda so we can better assist you with any issues during the course.

### Running Python Code

There are several ways to execute Python code:

1. **Script files** ‚Äì Create a `.py` file and run: `python <filename>`
2. **Interactive interpreter** ‚Äì Type `python` in the command line to test short snippets
3. **Jupyter Notebook** ‚≠ê **(Recommended for this course)**

### Launching Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook combines the Python interpreter, Markdown documentation, and visualization tools in a browser-based interface.

**To launch:**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

**To open in a specific folder:**
```bash
cd /path/to/directory
jupyter notebook
```

> **Windows users:** If the directory is on a different drive, type the drive letter first (e.g., `D:` then press Enter).

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Recommended Tools 

#### 1. Visual Studio Code

Jupyter notebooks can be launched and edited from a regular browser window as above, but most often people use dedicated editors, the most popular ([by far](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology#most-popular-technologies-dev-envs)) being Visual Studio Code, freely available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

You can then edit and run Jupyter notebooks in VS Code, just like regular files: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks. It is more convenient to use than a browser window, and is better customizable with lots of packages, themes, etc. 

#### 2. Git / GitHub

Git is the most popular version control system. You can "commit" your code as you make changes (think like checkpoints) and then can go back to previous versions even if you delete files. It also allows you to have multiple "branches" of your code with different versions, and a lot more. Check the tutorial here to get started: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ 

We highly recommend you use Git to track your changes and push your code to [GitHub](https://github.com/), so that e.g. even if you accidentally delete files you can recover your progress. 

#### 3. `uv` Package Managers

`uv` is a popular package manager for Python, which can be faster and more convenient to use than Conda or the default `pip`. Check the installation instructions and the guides [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to get started.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Are there alternative methods of launching Jupyter Notebook?</strong></summary>

**A:** Recent Anaconda versions include GUI launchers. Simply double-click the Anaconda Navigator icon and launch Jupyter from there.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: I have an older Python version in Anaconda. How do I switch to a newer one?</strong></summary>

**A:** Create a new virtual environment with your desired Python version and add it as a Jupyter kernel:

```bash
conda create -n py37 python=3.7
source activate py37
python -m ipykernel install --name py37
source deactivate
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How do I install required packages in a new virtual environment?</strong></summary>

**A:** Use `conda` or `pip` to install packages. For this course, you'll need:
- **numpy** ‚Äì Numerical computing
- **scipy** ‚Äì Scientific computing
- **matplotlib** ‚Äì Plotting and visualization
- **scikit-learn** ‚Äì Machine learning algorithms
- **requests** ‚Äì HTTP requests

```bash
source activate py37              # Windows: activate py37
conda install -c anaconda numpy scipy requests
conda install scikit-learn
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
source deactivate                 # Windows: deactivate
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How can I get the materials from GitHub?</strong></summary>

**A:** Choose one of these methods:

1. **Download ZIP** ‚Äì Visit the repository and download the `.zip` archive (simplest)
2. **GitHub Desktop** ‚Äì [Download the client](https://desktop.github.com), visit the repository, and click "Open in Desktop"
3. **Git CLI** ‚Äì Clone via command line (requires [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/downloads)):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:maxvanspengler/UVA_AML23.git
   ```
